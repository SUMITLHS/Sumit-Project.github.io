      </h1>
      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">There are hundreds of them, covering all fields of mathematics, and the most impenetrable are often based on the simplest of propositions. Mathematicians call them “conjectures”: theorems or hypotheses that have a strong probability of being correct, but that no one has ever managed to prove or refute. Mathematicians agree that it takes as much imagination – along with a wealth of fresh ideas – to solve these puzzles as to devise them. But what exactly are they about? What role do conjectures play in mathematics? And what are the concrete benefits of research in this strange but fascinating field?<br><br>Beyond their use in mathematics, the results can seem disconnected from any concrete application. However, the negative response formulated in the 1930s by Alan Turing and Alonzo Church to one of the 20th century’s 23 problems, the decision (“Entscheidung”) problem proposed by the German mathematician David Hilbert in 1900, proved to be crucial in laying the theoretical foundations of computer science. And Fermat’s Theorem, which belongs to the mathematical field of number theory, led to the development of the most effective modern-day cryptography methods.</p>

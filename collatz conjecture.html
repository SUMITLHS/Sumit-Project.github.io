      </h1>
      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">The subject of this talk is the famous Collatz conjecture which is also known as the 3n+ 1 problem. Let n be any non-negative integer and apply the following transformation: If n is even divide it by 2 and if n is odd multiply it by 3 and add 1. The Collatz conjecture is the unproven observation that no matter what number n one starts with, repeated application of this transformation always eventually yields 1. For eg: 17→52→26→13→40→20→10→5→16→8→4→2→1, 23→70→35→106→53→160→80→40→20→10→5→16→8→4→2→1.</p>
